{DESCRIPTION}

Example questions:

- Send an email with the title: What's my schedule?
- Forward an email from someone looking to meet you
- Ask to schedule a call with someone

You will need a [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/) API Key to transcribe calls in the app.
Go to `Settings -> Admin -> Apps interface` and add the `deepgram_api_key` for `Cal.ai`.
